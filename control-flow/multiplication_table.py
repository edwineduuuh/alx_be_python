# Instructions:
# Prompt User for a Number:
# Ask the user to input a number for `which they want to see the multiplication table: 
# Enter a number to see its multiplication table:.
# Save it in a variable name number
# Generate and Print the Multiplication Table:
# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10.
# For each iteration, calculate the product of the user’s number and the iterator 
# (the current number in the loop from 1 to 10).
# Print each line of the multiplication table in the format: “X * Y = Z”, 
# where X is the user’s number, Y is the current number in the loop, and Z is the product.
